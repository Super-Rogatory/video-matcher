# User Interface 

## Initial Interaction
After launching the interface, users will be prompted to upload the query video by dragging it into the designated area on the left side of the window. This area will have a white border at first and will glow, also there will be text inside the video that says "Drag video here".

## Search Process
After the video is dropped into the interface, the application will initiate a search within the database to find a matching video segment.

## Match Display and User Controls
When a match is identified, it will be presented in a section on the right side of the query video. Correspondingly, the control buttons become active, but only when the matched video segment is valid (meaning there is a video there).

## Visual Highlighting
To capture the user's attention on a successful match, the border around the matched video segment will be illuminated with a white glow. This visual signal serves to indicate the match's location to the user.
